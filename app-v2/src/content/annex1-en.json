    "annexReference": "DPP Appendix 1, Chapters 1-2",
    "developmentAndExplanation": "**Appendix 1 to the guidelines of Good Manufacturing Practice (DPP)** is a European regulatory document that sets the highest standards for the production of sterile drugs. Its main purpose is to ensure the highest possible level of safety for patients through the precise control of microbiological contamination.\n\n**KEY CONCEPTS AND PRINCIPLES:**\n\n• **Aseptic Production**: This is a special production process where already sterilized ingredients and components are combined in a strictly controlled sterile environment. It is critical that the finished product does NOT go through additional sterilization, so environmental control is critical.\n\n• **Contamination Control Strategy (CSC)**: A comprehensive, holistic approach to the prevention of microbiological and particulate contamination. It includes the integration of facility design, process parameters, control measures, continuous environmental monitoring and personnel training.\n\n• **Quality Risk Management**: A systematic approach to the identification, assessment and management of risks that could affect the quality of the medicine and thus the safety of patients.\n\n**HIERARCHY AND CLASSIFICATION OF CLEAN SPACES:**\n\n**Class A** (international mark ISO 5) → Direct working environment of a sterile product - the greatest challenge\n**Class B** (ISO 5 at rest, ISO 7 in operation) → Background and support environment for aseptic operations  \n**Class C** (ISO 7 at rest, ISO 8 in operation) → Areas for preparation of ingredients and components\n**Class D** (ISO 8 at rest) → Less critical support operations\n\n**KEY PARAMETERS OF CONTINUOUS CONTROL:**\n\n✓ Particles in the air (sizes 0.5 micrometers and 5.0 micrometers) - Continuous measurement in classes A and B  \n✓ Microbiological monitoring (seat plates, air sampling, surface prints)\n✓ Temperature and relative air humidity\n✓ Pressure differences between rooms (cascade system)\n✓ Air flow rate and air flow patterns\n\n**ADDITIONAL EXPLANATION OF ASEPTIC PRODUCTION:**\n\nAseptic production represents one of the most demanding processes in the pharmaceutical industry. Unlike terminally sterilized manufacturing, where the final sealed product is sterilized by autoclaving or another process, there is no possibility of \"correcting\" errors in aseptic manufacturing. Therefore, an extremely high level of control over all aspects of production is required.\n\n**Critical Control Points:**\n• Sterilization of all components BEFORE aseptic manipulation\n• Maintenance of aseptic conditions during the entire process\n• Trained and qualified staff\n• Validated clean air system with proven efficiency\n• Continuous monitoring of critical parameters",
    "practicalChallenges": "**MAJOR CHALLENGES WHEN IMPLEMENTING ASEPTIC PRODUCTION:**\n\n1. **Human Factor - The Biggest Source of Risk**\n   - Research shows unequivocally that personnel cause up to 80 percent of all contamination\n   - Extensive initial training in the technique of donning protective clothing is required\n   - Regular re-examination of knowledge and skills (usually at least twice a year)\n   - Observation of behavior and timely detection of bad habits\n   - Psychological readiness and understanding of the importance of each routine activity\n\n2. **Maintaining Air Quality During Production**\n   - Any physical activity causes particles to be lifted from clothing and surfaces\n   - The movement causes turbulence that disrupts the laminar flow of air\n   - Solution: Maintaining the speed of the unidirectional air flow between 0.36 and 0.54 meters per second in class A\n   - Use of appropriate materials for clothing and footwear\n   - Planning work procedures to minimize movement\n\n3. **Simulation of the Process with Gojišči**\n   - It is mandatory to simulate the entire aseptic process using a microbiological culture medium instead of the real product\n   - The required level of contamination must be below 0.1 percent (less than 1 contaminated unit per 1000)\n   - A minimum of three consecutive successful tests are required for initial certification\n   - Re-implementation after process, equipment or personnel changes\n   - The simulation must cover the worst possible conditions\n\n4. **Environmental Control Program**\n   - Continuous monitoring of particles in real time for classes A and B\n   - Regular microbiological sampling and trend analysis\n   - Investigation of the causes of deviations from expected values\n   - Coordination with other departments (maintenance, quality, production)\n\n5. **Endurance and Staff Fatigue**\n   - Working in full protective equipment is physically and mentally exhausting\n   - Limiting the time of continuous work in the aseptic area\n   - Adequate planning of breaks and shift changes\n   - Preventing a routine that leads to mistakes",
    "improvementIdeas": "**MODERN SOLUTIONS AND DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION:**\n\n→ Using artificial intelligence to detect anomalies and predict problems before they occur\n→ Digital twin technology to simulate airflow and optimize equipment placement\n→ Chaining of data blocks for immutable and secure recording of critical production records\n→ Augmented reality for interactive training of aseptic techniques\n→ Continuous monitoring platforms with a single control screen for all parameters\n→ Automatic material transfer systems with reduced human intervention\n→ Advanced vision control systems for real-time particle monitoring\n→ Cloud solutions for data storage and analysis\n→ Predictive equipment maintenance based on data analysis",

    "developmentAndExplanation": "**Highly efficient air cleaning** is the absolute foundation and the most important element for achieving and maintaining the required air quality in the clean rooms of the pharmaceutical industry.\n\n**CLASSIFICATION AND EFFICIENCY OF FILTERS:**\n\n• **Class H13**: Captures at least 99.95 percent of particles at the most penetrating size  \n• **Class H14**: Captures at least 99.995 percent of particles - this is the standard for classes A and B  \n• **Classes U15 to U17 (Ultra Low Penetration)**: Captures more than 99.9995 percent - only for the most critical processes\n\n*Most Penetrating Particle Size (MPPS) is approximately between 0.1 and 0.3 micrometers*\n\n**FILTER WORKING MECHANISMS:**\n\n1. **Inertia (for large particles)**: Particles larger than about 1 micrometer due to their mass do not follow the turning air stream and collide directly with the filter fibers and become trapped.\n\n2. **Entrapment (for medium-sized particles)**: Medium-sized particles follow the air flow, but due to their size, they cannot wrap around the fibers and thus become trapped on contact with them.\n\n3. **Brownian motion or diffusion (for very small particles)**: The smallest particles, smaller than 0.1 micrometers, move along a random path due to collisions with air molecules. This random motion increases the probability that the particle will hit the fiber and become trapped.\n\n**INTEGRITY TESTING - AEROSOL TEST:**\n\nA filter integrity test is mandatory to confirm that the filter:\n• Does not contain micro cracks, holes or other damage to the filter media\n• It actually achieves the required cleaning efficiency\n• It is correctly placed in the frame and that there is no air leakage past the filter\n\n**TEST PROCEDURE:**\n1. Before the filter - Generation of a test aerosol of known concentration\n2. Behind the filter - Scanning the entire surface of the filter with a measuring probe\n3. Allowable leakage for class H14 filter: 0.01 percent maximum (extremely strict)\n\n**DIFFERENT TYPES OF TEST AEROSOLS:**\n• Liquid aerosols (for example PAO oil - poly-alpha-olefin)\n• Solid aerosols (for example protective smoke)\n• Each type has its advantages and limitations",
    "practicalChallenges": "**CHALLENGES IN THE USE AND MAINTENANCE OF AIR FILTERS:**\n\n1. **Correct Installation and Sealing**\n   - Gel or liquid sealing system to prevent leakage\n   - Carefully check the sealing surfaces before installation\n   - Prevention of so-called bypass leakage past the filter\n   - Documenting the installation process\n\n2. **Monitoring the Pressure Drop**\n   - The initial pressure drop with a new filter is usually between 100 and 150 Pascals\n   - The warning is triggered when the initial value is doubled\n   - Increasing pressure drop indicates particle or moisture build-up in the filter\n   - Too high a pressure drop reduces the air flow and increases the load on the fans\n\n3. **Filter Replacement Procedure**\n   - Bag-in-bag technique to prevent the spread of contamination\n   - Disinfection of the area before replacement\n   - Use of personal protective equipment\n   - Reconfirmation of air quality in the room after replacement\n   - Checking air currents and speeds\n\n4. **Problems with Moisture and Condensation**\n   - Filters are sensitive to increased humidity\n   - It is necessary to preheat or regulate the humidity of the incoming air\n   - Regular check for signs of moisture\n   - Maintenance of relative humidity within permissible limits\n\n5. **Lifetime and Replacement Forecast**\n   - Typical lifespan is 3 to 7 years (highly dependent on conditions)\n   - Monitoring pressure drop trends for forecasting\n   - Planning the replacement before the critical point\n   - Ensuring a stock of replacement filters",

    "developmentAndExplanation": "**VISUALIZATION OF AIR FLOW - THE KEY TO UNDERSTANDING THE BEHAVIOR OF CLEAN SPACES**\n\n**BASIC AIR DYNAMICS:**\n\nAir flow in clean rooms is not random - it is a carefully planned system to control the movement of particles and microorganisms. Understanding visual flow patterns is critical to:\n\n• **Identification of dead zones** (areas with air stagnation where particles accumulate)\n• **Detection of turbulent areas** (where resuspension of settled particles can occur)\n• **Direct flow efficiency check** (does the air really flow in the intended direction)\n• **Equipment placement planning** (preventing air flow disturbances)\n\n**TWO BASIC TYPES OF AIRFLOW:**\n\n**1. LAMINAR (UNIFORM) FLOW:**\n\nLaminar flow is an idealized flow pattern where air moves in parallel layers without mixing between them. Imagine streams of water flowing smoothly side by side.\n\n**Features:**\n→ Speed: 0.36 - 0.54 m/s (for class A/ISO 5)\n→ Direction: Strictly vertical (from the ceiling down) or horizontal\n→ Particles: Pushed in one direction, no way back\n→ Visual: Smoke streaks flow in straight lines\n→ Application: Class A critical areas (above exposed products)\n\n**Advantages of laminar flow:**\n✓ Maximum protection of critical zones\n✓ Predictable particle movement\n✓ Rapid removal of contaminants\n✓ Minimal possibility of product contamination\n\n**Disadvantages:**\n✓ Very high cost (huge amount of filtered air)\n✓ Sensitivity to disturbances (personnel, equipment)\n✓ Careful placement of equipment is required\n\n**2. TURBULENT (MIXING) FLOW:**\n\nTurbulent flow involves the mixing of air masses, eddies and changes in direction. This is NOT necessarily a bad thing - a well-designed turbulent system can effectively dilute contaminants.\n\n**Features:**\n→ Velocity: Lower than laminar (typically 0.15 - 0.30 m/s)\n→ Direction: Mixing and swirling, diffusion\n→ Particles: Diluted throughout space\n→ Visual: Smoke streaks swirl and disperse\n→ Use: Classes B, C, D (support areas)\n\n**FLOW VISUALIZATION TECHNIQUES:**\n\n**A) SMOKE STUDIES**\n\nThis is the most common and intuitive method. We use special smoke or aerosol generators that produce visible, non-toxic particles.\n\n**Types of smoke generators:**\n• **Cold smoke** (glycerol aerosol) - Used for routine tests, visible in light\n• **Thermal smoke** (titanium tetrachloride - TiCl4) - Produces dense white smoke but is corrosive\n• **Glycol smoke** - Safe, non-toxic, most often used in clean rooms\n\n**Smoke test implementation protocol:**\n\n1. **System Preparation**: HEPA filters must be in operation for at least 30 minutes before the test\n2. **Smoke emission**: At various points (next to the filter, next to the equipment, in critical zones)\n3. **Observation**: Recording direction, speed, eddies, stalls\n4. **Documentation**: Videos, photos, written descriptions\n5. **Analysis**: Identification of problems and planning of corrective measures\n\n**B) ANEMOMETRY**\n\nMeasuring the speed and direction of air flow with measuring instruments. There are several types of anemometers:\n\n**Rotational anemometers** (with vanes) - Mechanical measurement\n**Thermal anemometers** (wire sensors) - Measurement of heat transfer\n**Ultrasonic anemometers** - High precision, two-dimensional measurements\n**Laser Doppler Anemometers** - Superior accuracy for research\n\n**C) COMPUTATIONAL FLUID DYNAMICS (CFD)**\n\nModern software tools allow virtual simulation of air flows BEFORE we build a clean room. This allows:\n\n→ Testing different equipment layouts\n→ Optimizing the position of air inlets and outlets\n→ Predicting the impact of changes\n→ Visualization of 3D currents and temperature profiles\n→ Identification of critical zones\n\n**PRACTICAL USE OF VISUALIZATION:**\n\n**Qualification of new premises:**\nBefore production begins, we need to prove that the air system is working as planned. Smoke tests are part of the operational qualification (OQ).\n\n**Requalification:**\nAfter major changes (new equipment, room conversions), it is necessary to prove efficiency again.\n\n**Variance Research:**\nIf there is an unexplained increase in contamination, smoke tests can reveal the cause (eg, flow disturbances due to moved equipment).\n\n**Staff training:**\nVisualization helps operators understand why proper material placement and movement minimization are important.",
    "practicalChallenges": "**CHALLENGES IN VISUALIZATION AND AIRFLOW STUDIES:**\n\n**1. INTERPRETATION OF SMOKE TEST RESULTS**\n\n• **Subjectivity of observation**: Different observers may interpret the same smoke pattern differently\n• **Photographic documentation**: It is difficult to capture dynamic three-dimensional flows in a two-dimensional photograph\n• **Reproducibility**: Results may vary depending on the day, temperature, humidity, position of the smoke generator\n• **Time Limitation**: The smoke dissipates quickly, so the time to observe is short\n\n**Solution:** Use of high resolution video, standardized protocol, multiple independent observers, combined with computer analysis.\n\n**2. INFLUENCE OF THE HUMAN FACTOR ON AIR FLOWS**\n\n• **Problem**: One person in a room can completely change the airflow pattern\n• **Body heat** causes natural convection (warm air rising)\n• **Motion** creates turbulence and disturbances in laminar flow\n• **Breathing** produces air jets\n• **Body surface** is a major barrier to air flow\n\n**Solution:** Tests should include simulating the presence of personnel (manikins with heating) or conducting tests with personnel present in typical working positions.\n\n**3. INFLUENCE OF EQUIPMENT ON AIR FLOWS**\n\n• **Massive equipment** (isolators, filling machines) creates shadows in the air flow\n• **Heat sources** (reactors, lamps) cause local convection currents\n• **Moving equipment** (robots, conveyors) creates variable disturbances\n\n**Solution:** Smoke tests in the worst conditions (worst-case scenario) with all equipment and work simulation.\n\n**4. COMPLEXITY OF CFD SIMULATIONS**\n\n• **High cost complexity**: Software and experts are expensive\n• **Accurate modeling required**: Every small detail (holes, slots, heat sources) affects the result\n• **Model Validation**: The simulation must be validated with actual measurements\n• **Computational time**: Complex simulations can take several days\n\n**5. DYNAMIC CONDITIONS DURING PRODUCTION**\n\n• **Problem**: Tests are performed in idle or simulated conditions, while production is dynamic\n• **Doors open and close** → pressure disturbances\n• **Materials are moving** → disturbances in the flow\n• **The number of people changes** → changes in patterns\n\n**Solution:** Continuous monitoring of particles in real time, periodic retesting, adaptive ventilation systems.\n\n**6. SEASONAL CHANGES**\n\n• **External conditions** (temperature, humidity, pressure) affect the operation of the HVAC system\n• **In winter and summer** the behavior of the system may differ\n• **Solution**: Qualification in different seasons, automatic compensation systems.\n\n**7. STANDARDIZATION AND HARMONIZATION**\n\n• **Different regulatory approaches**: EU GMP Appendix 1, FDA Aseptic Processing Guidance, PIC/S have different requirements\n• **There is no universal protocol** for conducting smoke tests\n• **Laboratory Accreditation**: It is difficult to find an accredited lab for smoke tests\n\n**8. TECHNICAL CHALLENGES OF MEASUREMENTS**\n\n• **Anemometers can disturb the flow** they measure (Heisenberg observation effect)\n• **Narrow areas** (between equipment) are difficult to access for measurements\n• **High accuracy** requires expensive equipment and calibration\n\n**9. MAINTAINING CONDITIONS DURING TESTING**\n\n• **Contamination with test smoke**: Thorough cleaning is required after the tests\n• **Pollution of HEPA filters**: Repeated smoke tests can shorten the life of the filters\n• **Production Shutdown**: Tests require time when the space is not productive",

Particles and microorganisms can accumulate in these zones because there is no effective removal. Dead zones are usually created behind equipment, in the corners of rooms, or where the placement of equipment blocks the planned air flow. Visualization with smoke tests is the best method for their detection."

DRY HEAT**\n\n*Principle*: Hot air at 160-180°C, 2+ hours\n\n*Advantages*:\n• No moisture (suitable for dust, oils)\n• No corrosion\n\n*Weaknesses*:\n• Poorer penetration\n• Longer time\n• Higher temperatures (not for all materials)\n\n*Usage*:\n- Glass vials (depyrogenation)\n- Powder products\n- Oils and fats\n\n**3. ETHYLENE OXIDE (EtO)**\n\n*Principle*: Gas alkylating agent\n\n*Advantages*:\n• Low temperature (40-60°C)\n• Excellent penetration\n• Suitable for sensitive materials\n\n*Weaknesses*:\n• Toxic gas (carcinogenic)\n• Long aeration (residue removal)\n• Slow (cycle + aeration = days)\n• Risk of explosion\n\n*Usage*:\n- Medical devices (catheters, sutures)\n- Plastic materials\n- Electrical equipment\n\n**4. IRRADIATION (Gamma, E-beam)**\n\n*Principle*: Ionizing radiation destroys the DNA of microorganisms\n\n*Gamma radiation* (Cobalt-60):\n- Excellent penetration\n- Processing of palletized products\n- Slower\n\n*E-beam* (E-beam):\n- Quick\n- Limited penetration\n- No radioactive source\n\n*Advantages*:\n• Low temperature (suitable for thermolabile products)\n• No chemical residues\n• Sterilization in the final packaging\n\n*Weaknesses*:\n• Can change polymers (discoloration, deterioration of mechanical properties)\n• Expensive equipment\n• Requires specialized infrastructure\n\n*Usage*:\n- Disposable medical devices (syringes, gloves)\n- Pharmaceutical products in final packaging\n- Surgical sutures\n\n**5. FILTRATION (\"Sterile Filtration\")**\n\n*Principle*: Physical removal of microorganisms with a 0.22 μm filter\n\n⚠️ **THIS IS NOT TECHNICALLY STERILIZATION** - it is a method of sterile preparation, not sterilization\n\n*Advantages*:\n• Suitable for thermolabile solutions\n• Maintains API (active pharmaceutical ingredients) stability\n\n*Weaknesses*:\n• Does NOT remove viruses and very small bacteria\n• Requires aseptic filling (additional risk)\n• Filter integrity validation (bubble point test)\n\n*Usage*:\n- Thermolabile biological products (antibodies, vaccines)\n- Solutions for aseptic filling\n\n**VALIDATION OF THE STERILIZATION PROCESS:**\n\nEach sterilization method MUST be validated:\n\n1. **IQ** (Installation Qualification) - Equipment installed correctly\n2. **OQ** (Operational Qualification) - Equipment works according to specifications\n3. **PQ** (Performance Qualification) - Process achieves SAL 10⁻⁶\n\n**Biological indicators**:\n- Spores with known resistance (e.g. Geobacillus stearothermophilus for steam)\n- Demonstrating that the process does kill microorganisms\n\n**F₀ concept** (for steam):\n- \"Equivalent time at 121°C\"\n- Minimum F₀ = 8 minutes for SAL 10⁻⁶",
    "practicalChallenges": "**PRACTICAL CHALLENGES:**\n\n1. **Choosing the Right Method**\n   - Must be compatible with the product (temperature, humidity, radiation)\n   - Economic justification\n   - Regulatory requirements (EtO has additional restrictions)\n\n2. **Overkill vs. Bioburden Approach**\n   - **Overkill**: Extreme parameters to ensure SAL (eg F₀ = 15)\n   - **Bioburden**: Less intense, based on knowing the initial load\n   - Trade-off between safety and product quality\n\n3. **Upload Validation**\n   - Different loading configurations affect heat/gas/radiation distribution\n   - Identification of \"cold spots\"\n   - Demonstrating reproducibility\n\n4. **Parametric Release**\n   - Product release based on process parameters (without sterility testing)\n   - Requires robust validation\n   - Regulatory approval required\n\n5. **Equipment Maintenance**\n   - Autoclaves need regular calibration\n   - Seals wear out → steam leakage\n   - Checking of biological indicators (each cycle or regularly)",

    "developmentAndExplanation": "**INTRODUCTION TO CLEANSPACE PLANNING:**\n\nCleanroom design is a complex interdisciplinary process that requires the collaboration of architects, HVAC engineers, microbiologists, and process specialists. The goal is to create an environment that **minimizes the introduction, generation and retention of contamination**.\n\n**BASIC DESIGN PRINCIPLES:**\n\n**1. CASCADE SYSTEM OF PRESSURE DIFFERENCES**\n\nClean rooms must have **positive pressure** compared to less clean rooms:\n\n```\nClass A (+25 Pa) → Class B (+20 Pa) → Class C (+15 Pa) → Class D (+10 Pa) → Corridor (+5 Pa) → Outside (0 Pa)\n```\n\n*Why?*\n- Prevents the entry of impure air from less clean zones\n- Air always flows from a cleaner to a less clean area\n- Typical differences: 10-15 Pa between adjacent classes\n\n**Exception**: Areas with dangerous substances (cytotoxics, pathogens) have **negative pressure** - air flows IN, not out.\n\n**2. ONE-WAY (LAMINAR) vs. TURBULENT FLOW**\n\n**Direct current** (Class A, Class B critical parts):\n- Air flows in one direction (vertically or horizontally)\n- Speed: 0.36-0.54 m/s (constant)\n- 100% HEPA filtered ceiling or wall\n- \"Washes\" particles from the area\n- There is no turbulence to mix clean/impure air\n\n**Turbulent (mixed) flow** (Class B-D):\n- HEPA filters cover 10-40% of the ceiling\n- Air circulates and mixes\n- Cheaper, suitable for less critical areas\n\n**3. GEOMETRY AND LAYOUT**\n\n**Rounded corners**:\n- Sharp angles (90°) are difficult to clean → biofilms\n- Recommended: Radius ≥50 mm at wall-floor, wall-ceiling joints\n- \"Coved\" design - rounded transition\n\n**Minimum equipment**:\n- Any physical obstacle disrupts air currents\n- Only essential equipment in the aseptic area\n- Built-in equipment (not free-standing)\n\n**Surfaces without gaps**:\n- Walls, floors, ceilings made of smooth, non-porous materials\n- No cracks or holes where particles can accumulate\n- Resistant to disinfectants\n\n**4. AIRLOCK SYSTEMS (Lock Chambers)**\n\nTransition chambers between different classes:\n\n*Features*:\n- They act as an air barrier\n- They prevent direct air flow between zones\n- They enable the calibration of personnel and materials\n\n*Types*:\n- **Personal airlock**: Donning/undressing protective equipment\n- **Material airlock**: Transfer of raw materials, components\n- **Pass-through chambers**: Small objects (documents, samples)\n\n*Pressure regimes*:\n- **Cascading**: Airlock pressure between the two rooms\n- **Sink**: Airlock has the lowest pressure (air flows NOTER from both sides)\n- **Bubble**: Airlock has the highest pressure (air flows OUT both ways)\n\n**5. SELECTION OF MATERIALS**\n\n**Walls/Ceilings**:\n- Modular panels (HPL - High Pressure Laminate)\n- AISI 316L stainless steel\n- Epoxy coatings\n→ Smooth, non-porous, resistant to chemicals\n\n**Floor**:\n- Epoxy resin (seamless)\n- Vinyl panels with a welded joint\n- Antistatic properties (prevention of static electricity)\n\n**Valves, taps, lamps**:\n- Flush-mounted (installed without protrusions)\n- Stainless steel 316L\n- Minimal horizontal surfaces (dust accumulates)\n\n**6. LIGHTING**\n\nRecommended: **300-500 lux** on the work surface\n\n*Lamp types*:\n- LED technology (long life, low heat)\n- Installed in the ceiling (flush-mounted)\n- Sealed (they do not allow particles to escape from the lamp)\n\n**7. ZONING**\n\nDivision of the building into functional zones:\n\n- **Black Zone**: Street, normal environment\n- **Grey zone**: Acceptance of materials, preparation\n- **White zone**: Clean rooms (classes A-D)\n\nTransitions between zones strictly controlled!",

        "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
        "explanation": "The Hot Loop system maintains a temperature of 70-80°C because most microorganisms do not survive or multiply at these temperatures. This is the most effective way to prevent microbial growth in the distribution system. At 70°C+ growth is practically impossible.",

        "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
        "explanation": "Until 2017, distillation was the only allowed method for WFI in the EU because it is the most reliable for removing endotoxins. Endotoxins (lipopolysaccharides from bacterial walls) are pyrogens - they cause fever and possibly death. During distillation, endotoxins do not evaporate (too high molecular weight). Since 2017, UF is also allowed.",
